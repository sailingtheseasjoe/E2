#Explanation of thought
#I will use RainCoordinates' Z position to spawn holos, with IDs corresponding to their position in RainCoordinates.
#These holos will use a raindrop model WHILE above GroundZPosition
#The holos will switch to puddle model if their raincoordinates Z position goes below GroundZPosition
#They will stay there until a certain amount of ticks passed, as puddles. The Z coordinate will keep decreasing but the actual puddle model Z position is capped at groundZpos
